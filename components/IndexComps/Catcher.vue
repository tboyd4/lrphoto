                    Hi, I'm Lindsey! My passions are investing my time and energy in people, music, and all things artsy. I'm from a small town in Missouri and now reside in Southeast Kansas. I studied both Music Education and Photography in college because I couldn't choose between a clarinet and a camera--so I chose both! I take pride in my attention to detail and ensuring that your photos are uniquely you. Let me capture your special moments for you!
